How its Made:
     ML Model Creation:
     step 1: First of all data is acquired through kaggle website.
     step 2: data analysis is done by using tools like pandas, numpy and more.
     step 3: various statistics has been done data is cleaned to desirable value.
     step 4: some of the important feature are selected for model training like (10th board,10th percentage,12th board and 4 more):
     step 5: Machine Learning Model has been created and the model is saved into pickle file(listed as model.pkl)
     Website creation:
     Step 1: Website is created using python WebFrame work Flask.
     step 2: front end is designed using HTML to extract features from student.
     step 3: model.pkl file is load and output has been predicted.
