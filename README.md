## Campus Placement Prediction Model

About App:

     This website is based on ML model prediction of whether a student get placed or not on entering his board percentage,degree board etc.
     
     
Language Used: HTML,Python

Tools and libraries: Numpy,pandas,Flask,SKlearn etc.


Dataset Used: Kaggle open-source Dataset(campus Selection) dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement

How its Made:
     ML Model Creation:
     
     step 1: First of all data is acquired through kaggle website.
     
     step 2: data analysis is done by using tools like pandas, numpy and more.
     
     step 3: various statistics has been done data is cleaned to desirable value.
     
     step 4: some of the important feature are selected for model training like (10th board,10th percentage,12th board and 4 more):
     
     step 5: Machine Learning Model has been created and the model is saved into pickle file(listed as model.pkl)
    
     Website creation:
     
     Step 1: Website is created using python WebFrame work Flask.
     
     step 2: front end is designed using HTML to extract features from student.
     
     step 3: model.pkl file is load and output has been predicted.
